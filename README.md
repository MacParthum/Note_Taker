## Note_Taker

A note taker powered by ExpressJS that allows you to save and delete notes.  In this class assignment we learn about how the front end and back end talk to each other.  The front end was provided so figuring out the server.js file was the main objective.  It was not without a lot of help from attentive teaching assistants that I was able to get all 3 functions working.  Posting and getting notes not nearly as difficult as the delete notes function on line 50 of the server.js file  ---- notes = notes.filter(val => val.id !== req.params.id)  ----
